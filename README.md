## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### O HAI! ãƒ½(Â´â–½`)/
  
I do front-end stuff! Been a software engineer for more than a decade now.
  
I'm basically an enthusiast of anything interesting, did a lot of work throughout the years with `Angular`, `Vue` and `React` on the Front-End side, but I also very rarely do some work with some `Node.JS` (JS and TS, but prefer TS!) and `.NET`.
  
I'm also kinda experienced with cloud techs (AWS, OCI, Azure), containerization (Docker) and CI/CD (GH Actions and Jenkins).  

And hey, if you're one of those seniors that is looking where's my GH activity - does your company publish everything in public repos? All the fun happens in private, if you're so interested then invite me to a challenge, bet I'd impress you into hiring me! ;)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Next.JS for that boosted React productivity!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something related to embedded hardware!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything tech!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
