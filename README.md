## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### O HAI! ãƒ½(Â´â–½`)/
  
I do front-end stuff! Been a software engineer for more than a decade now.
  
I'm basically an enthusiast of anything interesting, did a lot of work throughout the years with `Angular`, `Vue` and some `React` on the Front-End side, but I also very rarely do some work with some `Node.JS` (JS and TS, but prefer TS!) and `.NET`.
  
I'm also kinda experienced with cloud techs (AWS, OCI, Azure), containerization (Docker) and CI/CD (GH Actions and Jenkins).  
    
Liked something I did?
